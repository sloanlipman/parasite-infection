  - <i><b>The panel with a blue-grayish background is your Crafting Inventory. As
    you play through the game, you'll get different components used to craft Modules.
    Equipping a Module gives that character a special ability to use in battle. To
    craft a Module, drop a Battery, an Integrated Circuit, and a corresponding Module
    Core into the crafting slots to the right of the inventory! Who knows what Modules
    are even out there!</b></i>
