  - <i><b>Your name is Barry, and you are the first mate of the USS Hecate, an Earth-based
    peacekeeping vessel.</b></i>
  - <i><b>Recently, there have been rumors of the return of an alien race, long extinct
    and the subject of many frightening tales.</b></i>
  - <i><b>The Parasites.</b></i>
  - <i><b>Once one of these fearsome creatures has taken control of a host body, it
    can infect more victims by generating infectious spores.</b></i>
  - <i><b>The Hecate is under attack! Have the Parasites returned to wreak havoc on
    the galaxy? It's time to fight back, Barry. Contain and destroy this threat before
    it can infect your entire crew. Wake up and fight.</b></i>
