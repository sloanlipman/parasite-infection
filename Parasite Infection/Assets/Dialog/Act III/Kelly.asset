  - 'Kelly: We know how to make a cure, sir. We just need a few components.'
  - We need a power source, an injector, and a stabilizer to make the delivery device.
  - Strip some mechs for these parts.
  - We also need some Parasite DNA so that we can find the right genetic markers.
  - DNA from 3 aliens should be enough. I saw some tough-looking ones nearby.
  - Make the delivery device, synthesize the cure, and then combine the two.
  - Then come talk to me again.
